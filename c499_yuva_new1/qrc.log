WARNING (EXTQRCXOPT-140) : At line 25 of file qrc_dspf.cmd :
The "output_db -type dspf -compressed" option has been turned off because
it is in conflict with the "output_setup -compressed" option.  The former
will be obsolete in the future release.  Use the "output_setup -compressed"
option to set compression setting.
