It first combines all the <path>/spice_results/spice_rtl_difference_*.csv files into one file <path>/spice_results/spice_rtl_difference_summary.csv. This fils is then read and the number of flips is counted. If there is a flip, a \'1\' is reported for that output, and a \'0\' is reported for a no-flip case. \n\nThis information is written out in a table format into a file at <path>/spice_results/count_flips_summary.csv, in which the each row stands for one simulation, and each column contains the names of the output nodes\n This script reports the cases in which there was single flip, multiple flips, double flip, triple and atleast one flip. It calculates the probability of multiple flips given atleast one flip. So this means that, if there is a single particle strike causing a single glitch, and if it happens to cause a single bit-flip (fault), what is the probability that in such cases, more than one fault is likely to occur. If this probability is large, it indicates that, a single strike is likely to cause multiple faults at a high probability.\nAuthor:Nanditha Rao(nanditha@ee.iitb.ac.in)\n')
